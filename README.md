backbone-events-standalone
==========================

This is an extraction of the [Events] module of [Backbone]. I can be used
standalone, both in a (modern) browser and in a nodejs environment.

## Why another EventEmitter?

This project started because I appreciate the `Backbone.Events` interface while
I wanted to keep using it within a non-DOM environments.
